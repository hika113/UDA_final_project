    "### (a) Bing Image Search (damaged and undamaged buildings)\n",
    "First, we collected image files from Bing image search results using Web API (Bing Image Search API v7). The reason why we chose Bing instead of Google is that Google does not give us over 100 image files per keyword. The issue seems to remain unsolved. Although Bing provided us with more than 100 image files, the total number still did not reach 1,000. (Even we searched more popular words such as \"cat\" in this API, we could not obtain over 1,000 files.)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "In conclusion, we obatained approximately 300 pictures of damaged buildings and 500 pictures of undamaged buildings from Bing image search. In these files, most of the images appear to contain single building, while some images do not appear to contain buildings.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Also, as a data augmentation process, we flipped the images horizontally and add the flipped images to the data. Thus, the volume of data doubled (damaged: 600, undamaged: 1,000 in total)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Note 1: Before running the code below, plase create a new folder (named \"images\") in the folder where this ipynb file exists. Then, create two new folders (named \"damaged\" and \"undamaged\", respectively) directly under \"images\" folder. Thus, the structure of the folders should be as follows: >base folder > \"images\" > \"damaged\" and \"undamaged\"\n",
    "* Note 2: Downloaded image files should be stored in \"damaged\" folder for images of damaged buildings and \"undamaged\" folder for images of undamaged buildings. You need to transfer files downloaded by the code below to each folder (\"damaged\" or \"undamaged\") manually at the end of (a) and (b).\n",
    "* Note 3: You need to run all the code in part (a) twice to obtain images of \"undamaged\" buildings and \"damaged\" buildings separately. The details are describred in the following code."
